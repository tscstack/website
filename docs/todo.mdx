title: todo.md file

There is a [todo.md](https://github.com/get-indieship/indieship/blob/main/todo.md) file in the codebase. That is a checklist of tasks to be completed. There aren't that many tasks to complete. Everything is self-explanatory.

But, I want to say some words about this checklist:
```bash
[ ] - Update your product name
    - [ ] - YOUR_APP_NAME -> Your Actual App Name
    - [ ] - yourappname -> yourappname
    - [ ] - yourappdomain -> yourappdomain.com
```

- `YOUR_APP_NAME` is for the general name of your app. eg. `IndieShip` or `Quick Data Converter` or something else.
- `yourappname` is for the all lowercase name of your app. eg. `indieship` or `quickdataconverter`.
- `yourappdomain` is for the domain of your app. eg. `indieship.xyz` or `quickdataconverter.com`.

**Tips**: Use the `Find in Project` and `Replace All` feature to replace all the placeholders. This search and replace feature is available in most text editors and IDEs.
