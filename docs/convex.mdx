If you already thought to use this boilerplate, we think you already know how to use Convex.

But if you are new to Convex, we recommend you to check out their [documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/).

Convex is the backend framework for this boilerplate. It is a realtime serverless backend that allows you to write once and works everywhere.

Plus, if it doesn't exist, this boilerplate won't be exist :)

#### Suggestion

Keep all your `query`, `mutation`, and `action` functions and files in the `data` folder in `convex/data` folder, which will help you to keep your code organized and easy to maintain.
