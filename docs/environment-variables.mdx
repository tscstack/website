title: Environment Variables
---

There is `.env.local.example` file in the root directory of the project. This file contains all the environment variables that are required for the initial setup of the project.

Copy the contents of `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and `.env.prod` and fill in the values.

#### Type Safety

There is `env-client.d.ts` and `env-server.d.ts` files in the root directory of the project. These files contain the type definitions for the environment variables.

This is what `env-client.d.ts` looks like:

```ts
// env-client.d.ts
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly VITE_BASE_URL: string;
  readonly VITE_CONVEX_URL: string;
  readonly VITE_POLAR_PRODUCT_ID: string;
  readonly VITE_POSTHOG_KEY: string;
  readonly VITE_POSTHOG_HOST: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```

If you have to add more environment variables, you can add them to `.env.local` and `.env.prod` and then add them to `env-client.d.ts` and `env-server.d.ts`.

These will give you type safety when accessing environment variables in your code like `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` as `string` instead of `string | undefined`.

`env-client.d.ts` is for client-side environment variables.

`env-server.d.ts` is for server-side environment variables.

**Tip:** If your public environment variables are also being used in the server-side code, also add them to `env-server.d.ts`. But don't add the server-side environment variables to `env-client.d.ts`.
