title: Terms and Privacy Policy
---

Adding terms and privacy policy page to the website is a pain point too. But we already add [`src/routes/_legal`](https://github.com/tscstack/tscstack/tree/main/src/routes/_legal) folder and [`src/components/legal.tsx`](https://github.com/tscstack/tscstack/blob/main/src/components/legal.tsx) component to handle legal pages. Please take a look at those and you will understand it. After that, change it with your own terms and privacy policy.
