title: Analytics
---

Adding analytics to your website is a great way to track user behavior and improve your website's performance. 

You can use whatever analytics tool you prefer, such as Google Analytics or PostHog.

PostHog is configured and already integrated into the codebase as default.

See [`components/analytics/posthog-provider.tsx`](https://github.com/tscstack/tscstack/blob/main/src/components/analytics/posthog-provider.tsx)

#### Usage

Configure PostHog environment variables in `.env.local` and `.env.prod` files. And your part is done! We already wrapped it to the root layout.

PostHog analytics is disabled when you are in local development. See the component file to learn more about how it is configured.
