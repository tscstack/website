SEO is already configured. You don't have to think about it if you use TSC Stack. 

You can just read this and you are good to go.

### Configurations

#### SEO Meta

First, open [`utils/seo.ts`](https://github.com/tscstack/tscstack/blob/main/src/utils/seo.ts) file and configure SEO settings to improve your website's visibility on search engines.

There is the example configuration:

```ts
  const DEFAULT_TITLE =
    "TSC Stack - The Headless TanStack + Convex + Clerk Boilerplate for Shipping Fast";

  const {
    title,
    url,
    siteName = "TSC Stack",
    description = "TSC Stack is a headless TanStack + Convex + Clerk boilerplate to ship SaaS apps fast. Built with TanStack Start, Clerk auth, strict TypeScript, shadcn/ui, and modern workflows—no fluff, just shipping.",
    keywords = "TanStack + Convex + Clerk boilerplate, TanStack + Convex + Clerk starter kit, TanStack Start + Convex + Clerk, TanStack + Convex + Clerk SaaS boilerplate",
    ogImageUrl = `${VITE_BASE_URL}/og-image.png`,
    twitterHandle = "@heysithu",
    type = "website",
    locale = "en_US"
  } = opts;
```

Done!

#### Favicons
- Use [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate favicons for your website.
- Follow the instructions on the website to download the generated favicons and place them in the `public` directory of your project.
- Done!

#### Open Graph Image
- Create a image with `1200px × 630px` to get the best results on social media platforms.
- Name that image `og-image.png` and place it in the `public` directory of your project.
- Done!

### Usages

Here are some examples of how to use `seoMeta`:

```ts
// index.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  head: ({ match }) => ({
    // Use `default` as the title get show the `DEFAULT_TITLE` and `match.fullPath` as the URL.
    meta: seoMeta({ title: "default", url: match.fullPath })
  })
});
```

```ts
// _authenticated/dashboard.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/dashboard")({
  head: ({ match }) => ({
    meta: seoMeta({
      title: "Dashboard",
      url: match.fullPath,
    })
  })
});
```
