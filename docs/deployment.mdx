title: Deployment
---

Default configuration for deployment is Nitro which allows you to deploy your application to various platforms. You can read more about the [TanStack Start's deployment guide](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/hosting).

You can choose whatever deployment platform you want to use. But in all of those, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is the fastest and easiest way to deploy your application to production. You don't need to do anything as our boilerplate already configured with Nitro.

But if you decided to go with different option, you might have to change `nitro` plugin with the TanStack Start's supported plugins in `vite.config.ts` file.
